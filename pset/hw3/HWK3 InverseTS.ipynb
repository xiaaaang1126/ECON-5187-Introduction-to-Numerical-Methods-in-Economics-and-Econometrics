    "## Draw Data Using Inverse Transform Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "A half-normal distribution is often denoted as $N^+(0, \\sigma^2)$, which means it is a distribution obtained by truncating a normal distribution $N(0, \\sigma^2)$ at the point of `0` and keeping only the positive part (thus the \"+\" sign) of it. Since it cuts the **underlying normal distribution** into half, it is called a **half-normal distribution**. As you can see from the following graph, the density of $N^+(0, \\sigma^2)$ is twice as higher than that of the $N(0, \\sigma^2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This homework problem asks you to draw samples from the half-normal distribution $N^+(0, 2)$. It can be done in several ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Define a half-normal distribution using `Distributions.jl`, then use `rand()` to generate 5,000 random values. Draw a histogram of the data and overlay it with the theoretical density plot of $N^+(0,2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Hint: You need `Distributions` to define distributions and `StatsPlots` to draw the histogram and the overlaying density plot. You may also need `StatsFuns` to use the normal cdf function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Very similar to the above) Define a half-normal distribution using `Distributions.jl`, then use `quantile()` to generate 5,000 random values. Draw a histogram of the data and overlay it with the theoretical density plot of $N^+(0,2)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Now, the above approaches are easy to implement in Julia because you could define a half-normal distribution using Julia's `Distributions.jl`. What if not? What if you are working with a software that has the quantile function, the normal distribution function, but does not have a pre-defined half-normal distribution function? Well, we can still draw 5,000 random values using the following line. Explain the logic of this line of code. Draw a histogram of the data and overlay it with the theoretical density plot of $N^+(0,2)$. \n",

We used a three-step procedure to do this, and we drew graphs to have a visual confirmation on the transformation.
